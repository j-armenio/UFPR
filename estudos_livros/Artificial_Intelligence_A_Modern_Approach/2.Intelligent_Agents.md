# 2. Intelligent Agents

## 2.1. Agents and Environments

**Agent** is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its *environment* through *sensors* and acting upon that environment through *actuators*.

**Percept sequence** is the complete history of everything the agent has ever perceived.

**Agent function** is an abstract mathematical description that maps any given percept sequence to an action. Internally, this will be implemented by an **agent program**, which is a concrete implementation, running within some physical system.

## 2.2. Good Behavior: The Concept of Rationality

**Rational agent** is one that does the right thing, usually per *consequentialism*, captured by a *performance measure*. 

As a general rule, its better to design performance measures according to what one actually wats to be achieved in the environment, rather than according to how one thinks the agent should behave.
